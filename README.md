# NOTIFY SERVER IS UP (SMS)

## DESCRIPTION

Notifies when the computer powered on using the [Telesign](https://portal.telesign.com/signup) or [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/login)

The script uses a `.env` file that should contain the variables needed for the script to work properly.

## USAGE

After setting up the values in the `.env` file you should add the following to your crontab:

`@reboot /path/to/your/script/notify-server-up.sh >> /var/log/notify-sms.log`

## NOTES

For some reason the `base64` string generated by  the `telesign_encode_credentials` function differs on the last character, in contrast of the one generated in https://developer.telesign.com/enterprise/reference/sendsms. That's why I had to add the `sed s/K$/=/` to the output, but in normal circunstances I guess it shouldn't be needed.

Note that the value for *PHONE_TARGET* must have the _+_ character as prefix when using *Twilio*, but not for *Telesign*.
